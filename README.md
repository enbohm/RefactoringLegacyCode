RefactoringLegacyCode
=====================

Code which shows how to refactor and get legacy code under test. Inspired by books from M. Fowler and M. Feathers and by Sandro Manscusos 'Refactoring Legacy Code' session 
during JAXLondon 2012. This particular code was developed by me during my live coding session at Devcon2013.
